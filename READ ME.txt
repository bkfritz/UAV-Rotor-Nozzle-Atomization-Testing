This code base is written to read in and and process Sympatec data from a study 
comparing it to the Oxford Laser P15 data from the same study. The data is
reference nozzle data evaluated in the low speed wind tunnel.  The following measurements and
measurment conditions.
Sympatec:
All reference nozzles
- Full traverse at 1 and 2 in/s
- Every inch along the spray plume (Traverse Speed shown as 1 in/s should be 0)

Oxford Laser:
All reference nozzles
- Full traverse at 2 in/s
- Every inch along the spray plume (Traverse Speed shown as 1 in/s should be 0)

Patternator Data as done by UNL PAT Lab group.
Each reference nozzle was evaluated for spray deposit rate every inch along the spray plume
at a height of 12 in.  This data will be compared to the Sympatec optical concentration and
a flux value calculdated from the Oxford Laser data.


Notes on what data comparisons to be made.
1. Compare Sympatec Full scan results at the different air and traverse speeds.
2. Examine the correlation between the Sympatec optical concentration and the patternator data
   at the different measurement locations for the spot measurements.
3. Determine the volume diameter data using the point data weighted by the optical concentration
    and compare to the full scan results.
4. Determine the diameter x velocity curves using the Oxford Data, and use to weight the
    Sympatec lower airspeed data to see if it brings into agreement with the higher airspeed data.
5. Compare Sympatec and Oxford full scan results at same airspeeds.
6. Using raw Oxford data, determine the flux at each measurement location and compare to the
    Sympatec optical concentration and the patternator data.
7. Using raw Oxford data, determine the volume (flux) weighted and velocity and volume weighted
    diameter data.
8. Main object is to determine the best approach to collected data for the UAV rotor wash
    measurements in which different setups will require multiple location measurements and
    will be further complicated by different airspeed conditions due to changes in rotor speed.

For each nozzle type, assume their are two measurement methods, full traverse and spot measurements.

For the full traverse, there are two airspeeds and two traverse speeds.

For the spot measurements, there are spot measurements every inch at one airspeed.
NOTE: I need to redo this data with measurements every inch at both airspeeds (2 and 18 mph).

The nozzles included in this study are:
11001 @ 65.3 psi
11003 @ 43.5 psi
11006 @ 29.0 psi
8008 @ 31.9 psi
6510 @ 17.4 psi
6515 @ 14.5 psi

NOTE that there are two pressures for the 8008, 6510, and 6515 nozzles, but the ones above 
are those specified by the new ASABE S572.3 Standard.

With this study, all measurements for the Sympatec data were done using the R7 lens, with the droplet diameters
that define each of the 31 bins being given by the r7_bins list above.  The data in these columns is the cumulative 
volume distribution data, that is the total percent volume of spray contained in droplet equal to or less than the
diameter of the bin.  These data are the last 31 columns in the dataframe and are currently labled as
Ch1 through Ch31.

Files and what they do.

loadAndSaveSympatecData.py:
    Simply load the Symptec data from excel, slice out only columns of interest, adding in column headers as needed, 
    then saving the dataframe to a pickle file for later use.  The raw, individual replicate and mean data are 
    saved to files.

plotMeanSympatecFullTraverseData.py:
    Loads preprocessed Sympatec data from pickle files and slices out the full traverse data.  Calculates means for each nozzle and 
    creates bar plots.

plotIncrementalDistributionsFullTraverseMeans.py:
    Loads preprocessed Sympatec data from pickle file and slices out the full traverse data.  Calculates means for each nozzle and 
    plots the incremental and cumulative distributions for each.

plotMeanVolumeDiametersAcrossPlume.py:
    Plots the mean volumns diameters of Sympatec data across the width of the nozzles.

readProcessPicklePatternatorData.py:
    Reads in the patternator data processes it to get flow data that aligns with study measurement locations 
    and saves to pickle for later use.

loadAndSaveOxfordData.py:
    Loads the Oxford data from the individual text files, pre-processes the data, then
    saves the files to pickle file for later use.

Thoughts on the P15 data....Do I need to process the raw frame by frame data, or can I just use the summary data?
I think I can just use the summary data.  I need to look at the data to see if there are any issues with the summary data.
I may need to process the raw data just to get the flux data, but not sure I need this given I can use the Symptec Optical Concentration.
I think all I really  need from the Oxford data is the droplet diameter by velocity curve data.
